# Silent Failure in Modifying Non-Existent Element's innerHTML

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in HTML/JavaScript: attempting to modify the `innerHTML` property of an element that does not exist in the DOM.  The error does not throw an exception, but simply fails silently.

## Bug Description

The `bug.html` file contains a `div` element with the id `myDiv`.  The JavaScript code attempts to change the `innerHTML` of an element with the id `myDiv2`, which does not exist. This leads to a silent failure; the intended changes are not applied, and there is no console error to indicate the problem.  This can be very difficult to debug because there are no visible errors, and the expected changes simply do not occur.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.html` file presents a solution.  It utilizes a check to verify the element's existence before attempting modification, preventing the silent failure and providing an alternative action (in this case, console logging of an error) if the element is not found.
